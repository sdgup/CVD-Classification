# CVD-Classification

BUSINESS PROBLEM
In the whole world, Cardiovascular Diseases (CVD) are rising every day and this is becoming one of the major issues for children to old aged people. This disease is affecting the whole spectrum of ages. This is the leading cause of death in the US. One person in the US dies every 36 seconds and in every 4 deaths, one is caused by CVDs (Prevention, Accessed March 12, 2020.). Between 2016 and 2017, the United States spent $363 billion on heart disease. This covers the costs of medical services, medications, and lost productivity as a result of mortality (Virani SS, 2021).
After all the research and improvements in the medical field, the rate of CVD is gradually increasing at a consistent rate. Our business problem is to find out relevant factors associated with the CVDs using different data mining models.


METHODOLOGY- DATA MINING APPROACH 
In this report, we will be emphasizing the SEMMA model which was introduced by the SAS institute. SEMMA stands for Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, and Assess, and it refers to the steps in a data mining project. The SAS Institute views the process as a five-stage cycle:
1.	Sample  This stage is the initial step and a small portion of the large dataset (sample) is being separated which contains significant information but is small enough to manipulate quickly. This step is optional and can be carried out depending on the dataset size.
2.	Explore  This step consists of different data exploration to find out any significant anomalies or trends in the data.
3.	Modify  This step modifies or transforms the data for better consumption in the models created later.
4.	Model  This stage involves modeling the data by instructing the program to look for a combination of data that consistently predicts a desired outcome.
5.	Asses  This step involves examining the data and judging how well it performs by evaluating and comparing the utility and reliability of the data mining discoveries.
Despite the fact that the SEMMA procedure is independent of the DM tool of choice, it is tied to the SAS Enterprise Miner software and purports to guide the user through the development of DM applications. SEMMA is a simple method that allows for the orderly and proper creation and management of DM projects. It, therefore, provides a framework for his conception, creation, and progress, assisting in the presentation of business solutions as well as the identification of de DM's business objectives.
